"""
A description of a set of changes to a file tree to be made as part of
a git commit, modeled as zero or more file `additions` and zero or more
file `deletions`.

Both fields are optional; omitting both will produce a commit with no
file changes.

`deletions` and `additions` describe changes to files identified
by their path in the git tree using unix-style path separators, i.e.
`/`.  The root of a git tree is an empty string, so paths are not
slash-prefixed.

`path` values must be unique across all `additions` and `deletions`
provided.  Any duplication will result in a validation error.

### Encoding

File contents must be provided in full for each `FileAddition`.

The `contents` of a `FileAddition` must be encoded using RFC 4648
compliant base64, i.e. correct padding is required and no characters
outside the standard alphabet may be used.  Invalid base64
encoding will be rejected with a validation error.

The encoded contents may be binary.

For text files, no assumptions are made about the character encoding of
the file contents (after base64 decoding).  No charset transcoding or
line-ending normalization will be performed; it is the client's
responsibility to manage the character encoding of files they provide.
However, for maximum compatibility we recommend using UTF-8 encoding
and ensuring that all files in a repository use a consistent
line-ending convention (`\n` or `\r\n`), and that all files end
with a newline.

### Modeling file changes

Each of the the five types of conceptual changes that can be made in a
git commit can be described using the `FileChanges` type as follows:

1. New file addition: create file `hello world\n` at path `docs/README.txt`:

       {
         "additions" [
           {
             "path": "docs/README.txt",
             "contents": base64encode("hello world\n")
           }
         ]
       }

2. Existing file modification: change existing `docs/README.txt` to have new
   content `new content here\n`:

       {
         "additions" [
           {
             "path": "docs/README.txt",

  Appends a commit to the given branch as the authenticated user.
  
  This mutation creates a commit whose parent is the HEAD of the provided
  branch and also updates that branch to point to the new commit.
  It can be thought of as similar to `git commit`.
  
  ### Locating a Branch
  
  Commits are appended to a `branch` of type `Ref`.
  This must refer to a git branch (i.e.  the fully qualified path must
  begin with `refs/heads/`, although including this prefix is optional.
  
  Callers may specify the `branch` to commit to either by its global node
  ID or by passing both of `repositoryNameWithOwner` and `refName`.  For
  more details see the documentation for `CommittableBranch`.
  
  ### Describing Changes
  
  `fileChanges` are specified as a `FilesChanges` object describing
  `FileAdditions` and `FileDeletions`.
  
  Please see the documentation for `FileChanges` for more information on
  how to use this argument to describe any set of file changes.
  
  ### Authorship
  
  Similar to the web commit interface, this mutation does not support
  specifying the author or committer of the commit and will not add
  support for this in the future.
  
  A commit created by a successful execution of this mutation will be
  authored by the owner of the credential which authenticates the API
  request.  The committer will be identical to that of commits authored
  using the web interface.
  
  If you need full control over author and committer information, please
  use the Git Database REST API instead.
  
  ### Commit Signing
  
  Commits made using this mutation are automatically signed by GitHub if
  supported and will be marked as verified in the user interface.
